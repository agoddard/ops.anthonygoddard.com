I had a great time this morning as a guest of the [Food Fight podcast](http://foodfightshow.org) with [Bryan Berry](https://twitter.com/bryanwb), [Nathen Harvey](https://twitter.com/nathenharvey), [Brandon Burton](https://twitter.com/solarce) and the always awesome [James Cuff](https://twitter.com/jamesdotcuff). 

We started a discussion about the role of DevOps in research computing and solving 'the big problems' of the world and I had a chance to give a brief look into some of the work we're doing on the [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org) project. I hope the conversation continues, hopefully we'll get an opportunity to record a sequel.
